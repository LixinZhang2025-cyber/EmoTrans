# **Deep Learning Approaches for Enhancing Machine Translation in Emotionally Driven Contexts**

## **Overview**
Emotionally driven contexts pose significant challenges for machine translation (MT) systems. Traditional MT models often struggle to preserve emotional subtleties, leading to misinterpretations of sentiment, tone, and intent. This repository presents a deep learning-based framework that improves translation quality in emotionally rich scenarios. Our approach leverages recurrent neural networks (RNNs), attention mechanisms, and transformer architectures to enhance emotional fidelity in translations.

## **Features**
- **Sentiment-Aware Embeddings:** Ensures that emotional tone is maintained during translation.
- **Contextual Sentiment Scoring:** Integrates sentiment-aware adjustments in the training phase.
- **Transformer-Based Approach:** Utilizes pre-trained models like BERT and GPT to capture complex linguistic and emotional patterns.
- **Emotion-Annotated Dataset:** Supports training on multilingual corpora with labeled emotions.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Outperforms traditional models in BLEU scores and emotional consistency metrics.

## **Installation**
